# Job Runner

A scalable and secure custom job runner for Laravel 11x applications, allowing for background execution of PHP classes independently of Laravel's built-in queue system. This job runner supports error handling, configurable retries, logging, and an optional web-based dashboard.


## Features
- Custom Background Execution: Run PHP classes as background jobs outside of Laravel's built-in queue system.
- Cross-Platform Support: Execute jobs on both Windows and Unix-based systems.
- Error Handling and Logging: Capture and log errors in a separate log file with status tracking (e.g., running, completed, failed).
- Retry Mechanism: Configurable retry attempts for failed jobs.
- Security: Validate class and method names and restrict background execution to pre-approved classes.
- A Web-based dashboard for job status monitoring, job delays, and priority-based execution.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tichzvidzayi/jobrunner.git
    ```
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3. Set up your `.env` file.

### Usage

To run a job in the background, use the following command:

```php
runBackgroundJob('App\Jobs\SampleJob', 'handle');


```

### To test the backgroundjob run the following command

```bash
    php App/Test/BackgroundJobRunnerTestScript.php

```

## Configuring Retries, Delays, and Priorities
The job runner supports configuring retry attempts, delays, and priority levels for job execution. Set these parameters in the config/jobrunner.php file.

- Retries: Set the number of retries for a failed job.
- Delays: Specify a delay time (in seconds) before a job is executed.
- Priority: Jobs with higher priority will run before those with lower priority.

## Logging
Logs are stored in the storage/logs directory:

Job Logs: Track job execution statuses in background_jobs.log.
Error Logs: Errors are recorded in background_jobs_errors.log.

### Security
For security, only pre-approved classes can be executed as background jobs. Class and method names are validated to prevent unauthorized code execution. 
To register classes allowed for background execution, add them to the config/jobrunner.php file:
